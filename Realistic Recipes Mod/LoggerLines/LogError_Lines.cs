Either you messed with the mod's code or your computer's memory has been hit by a gamma ray. Very misfortunate in the second case.\n Anyway, to fix the problem try restarting. If you see this message again or if you already restarted your PC, delete the mod from your device and then re-download it from Nexus' official website at: https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/###. If this KEEPS happening, send a message to the maker of the mod (myself) on Discord at: https://discord.com/channels/324207629784186882/324210292194279424 (copy-paste it on your internet browser), feel free to ping me -> @JacquyAnto - however, I cannot garantee a quick response time.";
